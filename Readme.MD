# ü¶Å Directed Ecosystem Food Web (Trophic Levels)

This repository contains a visualization and analysis of a **directed ecosystem food web**, illustrating the flow of energy between different trophic levels.

## üñºÔ∏è Visualization

Here is the primary visualization of the food web:

## üåø Project Overview

The core of this project is a graph visualization that maps the feeding relationships between organisms in an ecosystem.

* **Goal:** To clearly represent the complex predatory-prey interactions and the hierarchical structure of energy transfer within a simplified ecological system.
* **Key Concept:** Energy flows from lower trophic levels (**Producers**) to higher ones (**Consumers**). Arrows indicate the direction of energy flow (from the organism being eaten $\rightarrow$ to the organism that eats it).

## üî¨ Understanding the Trophic Levels

The nodes (organisms) are color-coded to represent their **trophic level**, which is their position in the food chain.

| Trophic Level | Color | Example Organisms | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Producers** | Green | **Grass** | Organisms that produce their own food, forming the base of the food web. |
| **Primary Consumers** | Pink | **Rabbit**, **Deer**, **Frog** | Herbivores that feed directly on producers. |
| **Secondary Consumers** | Blue | **Snake**, **Eagle** | Carnivores or omnivores that feed on primary consumers. |
| **Tertiary Consumers** | Orange | **Lion**, **Tiger** | Carnivores that feed on secondary or primary consumers (apex predators in this model). |

### Graph Metrics

The visualization provides the following metrics about the network structure:

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Nodes** | 8 |
| **Edges** | 10 |
| **Density** | 0.179 |

## ü§ù Contribution

This visualization can be the basis for ecological analyses, network science studies, or educational resources. Contributions to further analyze the web's stability, centrality, or vulnerability are welcome!
